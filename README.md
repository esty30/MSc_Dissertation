The Association Between Level 1 and Level 2 Hypoglycaemia, Hypo-METRICS and Factors Affecting Individuals Living with Diabetes.

This repository contains the script used for my Msc Dissertation. The analysis focuses on the progression of hypoglycaemic episodes from Level 1 to Level 2 hypoglycaemia, drawing focus to symptomatic status, various demographic and clinical factors. 

Project Overview 

The project is divided into multiple stages:

1) Introduction Figures
2) Demographic Analysis
3) Principle Analysis
4) Progression Analysis (Overall and Symptomatic Progression)
5) Statistical Analysis (Chi-squared tests and Logistic regression)
   
*All scripts are named respective of their titles within the written dissertation
*All scripts produced outputs and visualisations 

Getting started:The scripts in this project require the following Python and R packages

Python Libraries
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- statsmodels
- scipy

R packages 
- tidyverse
- ggplot2
- gridExtra
- patchwork
  
Python bash:pip install pandas numpy matplotlib statsmodels scipy
R:install.packages(c('tidyverse', 'ggplot2', 'gridExtra', 'patchwork'))

Requirements to run the analysis: 

1. Threee primary datasets must be obtained 
Trial_sdh3.9_allprh_map.csv (SDH Level 1 data)
Trial_sdh3.0_allprh_map.csv (SDH Level 2 data)
Trial_baseline_characteristics.csv (Baseline characteristics of participants)

2. File paths must be changed from orginal scripts
3. Run on terminal or R studio with specific commands
4. If you use this repository, please reference: https://github.com/esty30/MSc_Dissertation

Future Directions 
- Learn and embed Power BI & Tableau for better data visualisations
- Learn shorter, efficent, more streamlined code
- Learn ways of using similar variables, names and format in code across all scripts within the same project

Final Notes

This README file provides a general and brief overview of the project, scripts, and how to use them.
